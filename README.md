# Hexrpg_Bot
Auction: 
This module reads the 20 auction listings closing the soonest and uses past data to predict a fair price for each auction. The bot will then display auctions currently listed below the fair price and allow the user the option to bid right from the console. 

Gambling:
This module will automatically execute a programmatic betting strategy in the Roulette-inspired Runic Aleatorem game for a set number of iterations and export the profit/loss of each bet to a CSV.
